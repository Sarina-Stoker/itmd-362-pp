# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables
